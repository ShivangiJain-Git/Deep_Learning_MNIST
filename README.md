#    Deep Learning - Digit Classification on MNIST Dataset

- ### CONTEXT
  The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available
  from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and 
  pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

- ### CONTENT 

	- Importing Necessary Libraries
	- Loading MNIST dataset
	- Getting Training and Test dataset 
	- Viewing Different digit images
	- Scaling Training and Test dataset
	- Creating Model
	- Compiling Model
	- Training dataset
	- Checking Performance on Test dataset
	- Predicting on single input
	- Creating confusion matrix
	- Plotting accuracy graph

- ### OBJECTIVE
  To build a image digit classifier using deep learning techniques which will classify digit images.

- ### Data Description
  This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. More info can be found at the MNIST homepage(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) .
